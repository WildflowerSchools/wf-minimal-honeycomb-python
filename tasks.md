# Tasks

* Decide whether to convert data to JSON in createDatapoint
* Decide whether to convert data to JSON for all variables
* If we convert data to JSON for all variables, add custom handler for operator objects so they don't get quotes
* get findDatapoint working
* Handle null returns (e.g., when data_id doesn't exist for getDatapoint)
* Figure out why associations field is empty even when we write to it
